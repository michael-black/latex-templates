# LaTeX Templates

Ready-to-go templates for LaTeX documents. To change the color schemes in the presentation templates, alter lines like the following:
```latex
    \definecolor{tamred}{RGB}{228,0,43}
```
Note that to use "Beamer_Sleek", you'll have to download the [Roboto Mono font](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Mono?query=roboto+mono), *and* you must compile the document using a XeLaTeX builder. The base build system typically does not work.
